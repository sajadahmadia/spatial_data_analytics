#Manipulating geo data 
In this repository, I've used gdal and ogr libraries to do the following tasks on geo data:
* querying the datasets
* fining the total surface area of some geometric objects like buildings
* obtaining building properties like the centroid(central long-lat positon of objects), the area of buildings
* computing the building densities in Amsterdam(nice to know, it is 28%)
* finding the building densities in specific neighborhoods in Amsterdam
* creating buffers for school data points
* measuing the area of Amsterdam that is outside the buffers around the schools 
* and a lot more in working with geom-based datasets
